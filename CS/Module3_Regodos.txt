SHORT QUESTIONS
1. What is fast Ethernet?
-is an internet standard the transmit data over 100mbps on a LAN

2. What is gigabit Ethernet? 
-is an transmission technology used in LAN that provides data with a speed of 1 billion bits per second

LONG QUESTIONS
1. Explain different ethernet specifications and standards
-Fast Ethernet standard is a transmission that provides a speed of 10 to a 100 Mbps. It is a very simple, plug and play configuration that can cover a limit of 10km. It is smaller compared to gigabit ethernet which makes it perfect for offices, schools and even homes.

-Gigabit Ethernet is a fast ethernet standard that delivers and transmit over 1 billion bits per second. With a larger scale coverage of 70km, it is vatly complicated compared to fast ethernet.This is perfect for large companies that require transmission for huge data
