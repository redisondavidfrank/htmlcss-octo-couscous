“The Black Swan”

    Black on flat water past the jonquil lawns
              Riding, the black swan draws
    A private chaos warbling in its wake,
    Assuming, like a fourth dimension, splendor
    That calls the child with white ideas of swans
              Nearer to that green lake
         Where every paradox means wonder.

    Though the black swan's arched neck is like
         A question-mark on the lake,
    The swan outlaws all possible questioning:
    A thing in itself, like love, like submarine
    Disaster, or the first sound when we wake;
              And the swan-song it sings
         Is the huge silence of the swan.

    Illusion: the black swan knows how to break
              Through expectation, beak
    Aimed now at its own breast, now at its image,
    And move across our lives, if the lake is life,
    And by the gentlest turning of its neck
              Transform, in time, time’s damage;
         To less than a black plume, time’s grief.

    Enchanter: the black swan has learned to enter
              Sorrow’s lost secret center
    Where, like a maypole separate tragedies
    Are wound about a tower of ribbons, and where
    The central hollowness is that pure winter
              That does not change but is
         Always brilliant ice and air.

    Always the black swan moves on the lake; always
              The blond child stands to gaze
    As the tall emblem pivots and rides out
    To the opposite side, always. The child upon
    The bank, hands full of difficult marvels, stays
              Forever to cry aloud
         In anguish: I love the black swan.

“The Black Swan” from The First Nine (1983)

    Black on flat water past the jonquil lawns
              Riding, the black swan draws
    A private chaos warbling in its wake,
    Assuming, like a fourth dimension, splendor
    That calls the child with white ideas of swans
              Nearer to that green lake
         Where every paradox means wonder.

    Although the black neck arches not unlike
              A question mark on the lake,
    The swan outlaws all easy questioning:
    A thing in itself, equivocal, foreknown,
    Like pain, or women singing as we wake;
              And the swan song it sings
         Is the huge silence of the swan.

    Illusion: the black swan knows how to break
              Through expectation, beak
    Aimed now at its own breast, now at its image,
    And move across our lives, if the lake is life,
    And by the gentlest turning of its neck
              Transform, in time, time’s damage;
         To less than a black plume, time’s grief.

    Enchanter: the black swan has learned to enter
              Sorrow’s lost secret center
    Where, like a May fête, separate tragedies
    Are wound in ribbons round the pole to share
    A hollowness, a marrow of pure winter
              That does not change but is
         Always brilliant ice and air.

    Always the black swan moves on the lake. Always
              The moment comes to gaze
    As the tall emblem pivots and rides out
    To the opposite side, always. The blond child on
    The bank, hands full of difficult marvels, stays
              Now in bliss, now in doubt.
         His lips move: I love the black swan.
